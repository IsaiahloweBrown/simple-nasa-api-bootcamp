I made simple API that uses nasa API to get the picture of the day

**Link to project:** coming soon



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

A user can selected a date and the code fetch data based on that day. It will output either an image or a video based on the day selected 


## Lessons Learned:

I learned that APIs are simply amazing and allow you access data in a more efficient than simply browsing. Some APIs regard headers for the key. The NASA requires a key to be put in the url for the fetch. Some APIs don't require a key. There are some Nasa API that don't require a key. The options are really limitless.
